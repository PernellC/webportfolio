          <p>Overview – The app’s mission is to provide access to an expert in any field and subsequently connecting them with the right expert for the task at hand.</p>
          <p>Objective – The goal is to find the user an answer or solution to any problem that they may be looking for the answer for.</p>
          <p>Role – UX Designer </p>
          <p>Duration – 9 months</p>
          <p>Process – Since I created Xpert from the ground up I utilized a 4 step UX design process. The 4 steps I took while creating the app were user research, design, testing and implementation.</p>
          <p>During the user research phase I received a lot of feedback from users as to what they would like in an app to find experts in addition to what competitors have on the market. From here I created 2 user personas that embodied the ideal
            user of the app. </p>
          <p>As I approached the design phase I went for a cheerful, welcoming, and easy to use design. During user testing I realized a lot of my missteps. A lot of the feedback had to do with odd or unfamiliar placement of elements along with poor
            contrast in certain sections of the app.</p>
          <p>In conclusion I ended up with a design that was more familiar to users and had higher contrast throughout the app. I was very happy with what I produced for users to test and their feedback. The main theme was do not reinvent the wheel,
            which led to a design that was clean and straightforward. </p>
